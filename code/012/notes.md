Three regressors in Table 6, col (2):

Ancestor from Kresy (dummy) — baseline Kresy–income gap at mean schooling.

Years of education (standardized) — the average return to schooling for everyone.

Kresy × Years of education — tests the mechanism: do Kresy descendants have different (higher) returns to schooling?

We focus on (3) because it directly answers the paper’s question about differential returns; (1) and (2) are necessary context.

# issues:
no obs should be 18262. not 18316 :(
